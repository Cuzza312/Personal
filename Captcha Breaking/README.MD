# Captcha Breaker

This is a model I made for a mock company where our team's goal was breaking Captcha's so we can then build better stratergies for Captcha to defend against other attacks.
The images for the data was gathered from Google's Captcha. My model was able to recognise Captchas with 85% accuracy. The model itself uses transfer learning from the prebuilt
VGG16 model, I then added some more layers including dropout to help with overfitting.
